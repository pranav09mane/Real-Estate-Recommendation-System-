🏡 Real Estate Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

The Real Estate Recommendation System is a data science–driven project that provides personalized property recommendations.
Users can search for residential, commercial, and hybrid plots based on filters such as location and budget.
The system also learns from user preferences to deliver tailored recommendations during future visits.
A minimal web interface is included as part of the project (project.zip), while the backend leverages machine learning for data-driven recommendations.

🚀 Features:
🔍 Search & Filter: Find plots by location, budget, and property type
🧠 Recommendation Engine: Learns from past searches for personalized suggestions
🗂 Property Categories: Residential, Commercial, and Hybrid plots supported
📊 Data-Driven Logic: Python-based search, filtering, and ranking
🛢 Database Integration: MongoDB stores listings & user history

🛠 Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Data Science & Analysis: NumPy, Pandas
Machine Learning: Random Forest (rf_model.pkl)
Backend Framework: Flask
Database: MongoDB
Frontend: HTML + CSS (inside project.zip)

🔎 How the Recommendation Works:
1. User Input → Filters like location = Tarabai Park, budget = ₹50,00,000
2. Search Logic → Matching plots are fetched from MongoDB or dataset
3. Personalization → User history is logged for future recommendations
4. Recommendation Engine → Random Forest (rf_model.pkl) suggests similar listings

📊 Dataset:
1. dataset.csv → Raw dataset of property listings
2. analysis_data.csv → Cleaned and preprocessed dataset used for model training


📌 Future Enhancements:
1. Deploy on cloud platforms 
2. Add advanced filters (area, amenities, builder reputation)
3. Improve recommendation engine using deep learning methods
